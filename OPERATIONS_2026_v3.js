## Workflow Explanation

### Clasp Setup and Sync
We set up clasp (Google Apps Script CLI) to allow working on files locally and syncing them with the remote Google Apps Script project.
- Usage: Due to permission issues with global installation on this machine, we use npx @google/clasp to run commands without needing a global install.
- Login: You completed the login manually in your terminal using npx @google/clasp login.
- Sync: We use npx @google/clasp pull to fetch files and npx @google/clasp push to send local changes to the remote project.

### Directory Cleanup
To keep the project focused on the 2026 version:
- We moved all files that do not end with 2026.js to an archive_old folder locally to keep them as backup.
- We kept appsscript.json and .clasp.json in the root as they are required for project function.
- Important: clasp does not automatically delete remote files on push when they are deleted locally. To remove the old files from the Apps Script web editor, you must delete them manually there.
